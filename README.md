# NOT READY YET

# Overview

This Repo is my attempt on making VR Games playable without actual VR Hardware

If you want to use it you need these 2 programs

- TrinusPSVR (https://www.trinusvirtualreality.com/psvr/)

    -> Set Mode to "SteamVR"
    
    -> Go to the Tracking Tab
    
    -> Set "Head Device" to "FreePieHead Position"
    
    -> Set "Left Hand Device" to "FreePieLeft"
    
    -> Set "Right Hand Device" to "FreePieRight"
    
- FreePie (https://github.com/AndersMalmgren/FreePIE)
